# KARIMO Source Repository Rules

## Release Protocol (MANDATORY)

When changes impact target repositories (installed KARIMO projects), you MUST complete ALL steps below. **The release is NOT complete until the GitHub Release exists AND is verified via API.**

### Preferred Method: Release Script

Use the release script for atomic, verified releases:

```bash
.karimo/scripts/release.sh 8.3.0        # Full release
.karimo/scripts/release.sh 8.3.0 --dry-run  # Preview only
```

The script handles: version bump, commit, tag, push, release creation, and API verification.

### Manual Release Checklist (if not using script)

```
[ ] 1. VERSION BUMP
    - Update `.karimo/VERSION` with new semver
    - Update `version` field in `.karimo/MANIFEST.json` to match

[ ] 2. CHANGELOG ENTRY
    - Add entry to `CHANGELOG.md` under new version header
    - Format: `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
    - Include: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed subsections as needed

[ ] 3. DOCUMENTATION UPDATES
    - README.md — Update version badge
    - .karimo/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md — Update version header
    - .karimo/docs/COMMANDS.md — If slash commands changed
    - .karimo/docs/GETTING-STARTED.md — If setup flow changed

[ ] 4. COMMIT ALL CHANGES (BEFORE TAGGING)
    - Commit version bump, changelog, AND documentation
    - Push to origin/main
    - CRITICAL: All changes must be committed BEFORE creating tag/release

[ ] 5. CREATE TAG AND RELEASE (ATOMIC)
    - git tag vX.Y.Z
    - git push origin vX.Y.Z
    - gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes "..."
    - Do these in immediate sequence

[ ] 6. VERIFY VIA API (REQUIRED)
    - curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/opensesh/KARIMO/releases/latest" | grep tag_name
    - Must show your new version
    - If not, the release is BROKEN
```

### CRITICAL: Never Move Tags After Release

**DO NOT run these commands after creating a release:**
```bash
# DANGEROUS - orphans the release:
git tag -d vX.Y.Z && git tag vX.Y.Z  # Moving tag
git tag -f vX.Y.Z                      # Force-updating tag
```

Moving a tag after release creation orphans the GitHub release (makes it a draft pointing to "untagged-*"). This breaks `/karimo:update` for all users.

**If you need to include more commits after release:**
1. Delete the release: `gh release delete vX.Y.Z --yes`
2. Delete the tag: `git tag -d vX.Y.Z && git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z`
3. Make your additional commits
4. Re-run the release script or checklist from step 1

### STOP CHECK

Before marking a release task complete, verify ALL of these:

1. **Release exists:** `gh release view vX.Y.Z` returns the release
2. **API shows latest:** `curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/opensesh/KARIMO/releases/latest" | grep tag_name` shows your version
3. **Tag matches HEAD:** `git rev-parse vX.Y.Z` equals `git rev-parse HEAD`

**If any check fails, the release is broken and must be recreated.**

## What Impacts Target Repositories

Changes to these files affect installed projects:
- `.claude/agents/*` — Agent definitions
- `.claude/commands/*` — Slash commands
- `.claude/skills/*` — Skill definitions
- `.karimo/templates/*` — PRD/task templates
- `.claude/KARIMO_RULES.md` — Agent behavior rules

Changes to these files do NOT affect installed projects:
- `install.sh`, `update.sh` — Installer scripts (source-only)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — Contribution guidelines
- `.github/workflows/karimo-test-install.yml` — Source-only CI

## Atomic Commit Workflow (MANDATORY)

**Iron Law: COMMIT AFTER EACH LOGICAL UNIT OF WORK — NOT AT THE END**

Bundling all changes into one commit destroys traceability. Each plan phase, task, or logical unit gets its own commit. This is non-negotiable.

### When to Commit

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Plan phase complete | Commit immediately |
| TodoWrite task marked `completed` | Commit that task's changes |
| Bug fix verified | Commit the fix |
| Refactor complete | Commit separately from features |
| Moving to unrelated work | Commit current work first |

### Workflow Integration

1. **During Plan Execution:**
   - Complete a phase/task
   - Verify it works (tests, build, etc.)
   - Stage and commit with descriptive message
   - Mark TodoWrite item as `completed`
   - Move to next task

2. **At End of Work Session:**
   - Show commit summary to user
   - Format: list of commits made with messages
   - Example:
     ```
     ## Commits Made This Session
     - `abc1234` feat(auth): add logout button component
     - `def5678` feat(auth): implement logout API call
     - `ghi9012` test(auth): add logout flow tests
     ```

### Commit Format

Use Conventional Commits:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Types:** feat, fix, refactor, style, docs, test, chore, perf

**Rules:**
- Imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature"
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- ALWAYS include Co-Authored-By footer

### Anti-Patterns (STOP if you catch yourself...)

- Saying "I'll commit everything at the end"
- Asking "do you want me to commit?" after all work is done
- Making one commit with unrelated changes
- Waiting to commit until user asks

# KARIMO Configuration Guide

## What is KARIMO?

KARIMO is an autonomous development **methodology** delivered via Claude Code configuration. It transforms product requirements into shipped code using AI agents, GitHub automation, and structured human oversight.

**Core philosophy:** You are the architect, agents are the builders, automated review is the inspector.

**Asset Management:** Visual context (mockups, screenshots, diagrams) can be stored and tracked throughout the PRD lifecycle. Assets are organized by stage (research/planning/execution) and referenced in PRDs and task briefs. See [.karimo/docs/ASSETS.md](.karimo/docs/ASSETS.md) for details.

---

## Slash Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/karimo:research "feature-name"` | **REQUIRED first step** — Create PRD folder + run research |
| `/karimo:plan --prd {slug}` | PRD interview using research context |
| `/karimo:run --prd {slug}` | Execute: brief generation → review → orchestration |
| `/karimo:merge --prd {slug}` | Create final PR to main after execution completes |
| `/karimo:dashboard [--prd {slug}]` | Monitor progress and system health |
| `/karimo:feedback` | Intelligent feedback with auto-detection |
| `/karimo:configure` | Create or update project configuration |
| `/karimo:update` | Check for and apply KARIMO updates |
| `/karimo:doctor [--test]` | Check installation health |
| `/karimo:help` | Help & documentation search |

---

## Adoption Phases

KARIMO uses three optional adoption phases:

### Phase 1: Execute PRD
Your first planning process with KARIMO:
- Run `/karimo:research "feature-name"` to create PRD folder and run research
- Run `/karimo:plan --prd {slug}` to create PRD through agent interviews
- Agent teams coordinate task execution
- Wave-based execution (wave 2 waits for wave 1 to merge)
- PRs target main directly with labels for tracking
- Claude Code handles worktrees automatically via `isolation: worktree`

**This is where everyone starts.** Phase 1 is fully functional out of the box.

### Phase 2: Automate Review
Add automated code review to your workflow. Choose your provider:

| Provider | Pricing | Best For |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Greptile** | $30/month flat | High volume (50+ PRs/month) |
| **Claude Code Review** | $15-25 per PR | Low-medium volume, native Claude integration |

Both providers support:
- Automated revision loops when issues are found
- Model escalation (Sonnet → Opus) after first failure
- Hard gate after 3 failed attempts (needs human review)

**Optional but highly recommended.** Run `/karimo:configure --review` to choose your provider.

### Phase 3: Monitor & Review
GitHub-native monitoring — no separate dashboard needed:
- `/karimo:status` — Smart monitoring (no arg = all PRDs, with arg = specific details)
- GitHub — PR comments, labels, activity
- Claude Code analytics — Review usage (if using Code Review)

---

## Execution Model

KARIMO uses a PR-centric workflow with wave-based execution:

**Key Features:**
- PRs target `main` directly (no feature branches)
- Tasks execute in wave order (wave 2 waits for wave 1 to merge)
- Claude Code manages worktrees via `isolation: worktree`
- PR labels replace GitHub Projects for tracking
- Branch naming: `worktree/{prd-slug}-{task-id}`

**Requirements:**
- GitHub MCP server configured in Claude Code
- gh CLI authenticated with `repo` scope

**Benefits:**
- Complete traceability (task → PR → merge)
- Wave-based parallel execution
- PR-based code review workflow
- Automated review integration (Greptile or Code Review)
- Git state reconstruction for crash recovery

---

## Configuration

KARIMO configuration lives in `.karimo/config.yaml`. On first `/karimo:plan` or `/karimo:configure`, the investigator agent auto-detects project context and populates the config file.

Key settings:
- **Project** — Runtime, framework, package manager
- **Commands** — Build, lint, test, typecheck commands
- **Boundaries** — Files agents must not touch (`never_touch`) or must flag for review (`require_review`)
- **GitHub** — Owner, repository, default branch
- **Learnings** — Patterns and anti-patterns stored in `.karimo/learnings/` (categorized directories)

---

## Agent Rules

Agent behavior is governed by `.claude/KARIMO_RULES.md`. This file defines:
- Task execution boundaries
- Wave-ordered execution model
- PR creation guidelines
- Finding propagation between waves

---

## Installed Components

When you run `install.sh`, these files are added:

| Location | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| `.claude/plugins/karimo/agents/` | **22** agent definitions (16 coordination + 6 task agents) |
| `.claude/plugins/karimo/commands/` | **11** slash commands |
| `.claude/plugins/karimo/skills/` | **8** skills (2 coordination + 3 research + 3 task agent) |
| `.claude/plugins/karimo/KARIMO_RULES.md` | Agent behavior rules |
| `.karimo/templates/` | **18** templates |
| `.karimo/scripts/` | **1** CLI script (asset management) |

**Optional:** Run `/karimo:configure --review` to choose and configure your automated code review provider (Greptile or Claude Code Review).

### Agent Types

**Coordination agents:** interviewer, investigator, researcher, refiner, reviewer, brief-reviewer, brief-corrector, brief-writer, pm, review-architect, feedback-auditor

**Task agents:** implementer, tester, documenter (each with Sonnet and Opus variants)

## Learnings

Project-specific learnings are stored in `.karimo/learnings/` (categorized directories: patterns, anti-patterns, project-notes, execution-rules) and populated via `/karimo:feedback`. This keeps CLAUDE.md minimal while providing agents with accumulated knowledge.
